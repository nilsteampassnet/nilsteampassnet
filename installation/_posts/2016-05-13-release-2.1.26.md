## Minor (but interesting) Changes

Some changes that may interest you:

- Estonian language was added
- Any new sub-folder created by a user needs to have a minimum complexity level at least equal to the top-folder one. *Note that this restriction is not applied for Manager and Administrator roles*.
- After 3 bad login attemps, the user needs to wait 10 seconds before a new attempt.

## Security analysis with RIPS

Teampass was analyzed for security bugs with RIPS by [Risptech](https://www.ripstech.com/).

This analysis identified mainly 2 issues:

- security issue in API with the usage of `parse_str` (which has been removed)
- potential issue using  `$_SESSION` which will be removed by the introduction of the configuration file instead of `$_SESSION` variable.
