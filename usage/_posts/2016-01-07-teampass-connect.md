**Teampass Connect** is an add-on working with Firefox web-browser.



## Goal

Its goal is to grab the Items existing in your Teampass instance related to the webpage opened in your web-browser, 
and to permit to fill-in the login/password fields inside those web pages.

## Download

[Download last release (0.03)](https://mega.nz/#!JdAnAZxa!DJBm8CU5aPLAsRathpFoWtRQSJfqp9GwvDkYuDRduBw)

## Features

The main features of **Teampass Connect** are:

 * Get the couple ```login/password``` related to the open web-page
 * Fill-in the login/password fields in the web-page
 * Automatically submit the page
 * Secure access to Teampass Server through the API key
 * Usage of local storage to give fast results

## How does it work?

**Teampass Connect** is sending the *web page URL* to your Teampass Server which performs a query to *list the Items* 
that fits the URL field with the one sent.

This Items list is then displayed and you can decide to fill-in the login/password fields with correct credentials.

## Requirements

 * For security purpose, it is mandatory to use an HTTPS with certified SSL to encrypt the exchanges between the 
web-browser and Teampass Server. Indeed user password is not encrypted overwise. 
This might not be necessary if you are using Teampass inside your own network (in a company scope for example).
 * It requires API enabled in Teampass Server
 * Users need an API key to get allowed to connect to Teampass Server database
